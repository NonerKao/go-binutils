This file documents the design of this project, and hopefully some ELF-related 
knowledge.

General Notes
-------------

Now we are at the very beginning stage, so the design may change rapidly from 
commit to commit.

This is a project basiclly for learning GO language and ELF format, Any 
suggestion or critics are welcome!


Installation
------------
Simply `make` and `make install`.  Please make sure you have setup the `GOPATH` environment variable correctly.


Project Structure
-----------------

Traditionally, GNU project treats the binary tools in the binutils-gdb archive.
Most of the GNU/Linux distributions partition the whole into two packages, 
binutils and gdb.

We re-implement the binutils part in GO, based on the official debug/elf 
package, and do not reference to the original code base.  We plan to implement
this project similar to what busybox does:  unified entity, multiple usage. 

In the top directory (go-binutils/), there are only one go file:
+ main.go: package main, the entry point, doing flag parsing stuff.

There will be a directory called common, in which are go sources of package
common, containing output-related features, libbfd-like helpers, etc.

And finally, the individual directories, containing utilities from addr2line 
to strip.


Contribution
------------

Since I do this project for learning purpose and for fun, please feel free to 
give suggestions, critics, issues and PRs.  Thanks!
